MooseX::Event::Role::ClassMethods - Make MooseX::Event methods available as class methods on a singleton

=head1 VERSION

version 0.3.0_1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package Example {
      use MooseX::Singleton;
      use MooseX::Event;

      with 'MooseX::Event::Role::ClassMethods';

      has_event 'pinged';

      sub ping {
          my $self = shift;
          $self->emit('pinged');
      }
  }

  use Event::Wrappable;

  Example->on( pinged => event { say "Got a ping!" } );
  Example->on( pinged => event { say "Got another ping!" } );
  Example->ping; # prints "Got a ping!" and "Got another ping!"
  Example->remove_all_listeners( "pinged" ); # Remove all of the pinged listeners
  Example->once( pinged => event { say "First ping." } );
  Example->ping; Example->ping; # Only prints "First ping." once
  my $listener = Example->on( pinged => event { say "Ping" } );
  Example->remove_listener( pinged => $listener );
  Example->ping(); # Does nothing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes it's handy to be able to call object methods directly on a
singleton class, without having to call instance yourself.  This wraps up
the L<MooseX::Event::Role> to allow this.  Your class must provide an
instance method that returns the singleton object.  One way to do this is
with the L<MooseX::Singleton> class, as in the example, but you can easily
role your own if you prefer.
